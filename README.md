## The challenge did not include any significant animaitons so I added a keyframe animation on the arrow. I like using keyframes for simple things like this to enhance the experience.
```css
  .arrow{
        animation-name:animate ;
        animation-iteration-count: infinite;
        animation-direction:alternate;
        animation-timing-function: ease-in-out;
        animation-duration: 2s;
        cursor: pointer;
    }
    @keyframes animate {
        0%{transform:translateY(0%)}
        100%{transform:translateY(25%)}
        
    }
```
